    <h2>Motto</h2>
    <p>
        You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, ‘I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.’ You must do the thing you think you cannot do. ~Eleanor Roosevelt

    <h2>Why GW?</h2>
    <p>
        I decided to take the GW Bootcamp because I need a career change. I currently work as an Admin Assistant in fundraising and it's just not for me anymore. After having my son, I realized I was bored and needed to rethink my career track. Since I had taken several graphic design courses, I decided let's look at what really creates the design of the web page. When I started playing around with the basics of coding and realized it was something that utilized my love of problem solving and creating something. Of course I realized the best way to really pick up new skills was a bootcamp and GW looked like one of the best out there that had everything I needed as someone new to the field. So here I am ready to learn!
